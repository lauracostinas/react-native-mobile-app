### About
This is a mobile application that helps you keep track of all the movies you have watched. This application will be implemented in React-Native.

### Functionalities
#### Authentication
There will be two user types. Authentication can be used in order to synchronize watched movies data with the server for the specific user so if the user logs from another device it can access that data. The other user type can be admin, who can add/remove/edit data for the movies.

#### Displaying Movies
Several movies in a list can be displayed on the home screen of the application (eg. popular, recommended). When selecting one movie a page is opened and the user is presented with movie details; also a back button (maybe).
At the top of the home screen there can be a search bar for finding movies based on their name.

#### Watched Movies
The user can add a movie to his watched list. He can also specify the date he watched that movie. Based on this data a chart containing the total hours spent watching movies over several days can be displayed.
The application should persist the user watch list locally (offline support). When an internet connection is set, the application should synchronize the data with the server (online support) if the user is authenticated.

#### Share
The user can share a movie via mail (or others?). (intent)

### Others
Animations will be present for transitions between pages.
